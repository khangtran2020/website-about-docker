    <h1>Virtualization vs Containerization</h1>
    <img src="image/container1.jpg">
    <p>Virtualization enables you to run multiple operating systems
        on the hardware of a single physical server, while containerization enables you to deploy multiple applications
        using the same operating system on a single virtual machine or server.
        Virtual machines are great for supporting applications that require an operating system’s full
        functionality when you want to deploy multiple applications on a server, or when you have a wide variety of
        operating systems to manage. Containers are a better choice when your biggest priority
        is to minimize the number of servers you’re using for multiple applications.
    </p>
    <p>Your use case matters too. Containers are an excellent choice for tasks with a much shorter lifecycle.
        With their fast set up time, they are suitable for tasks that may only take a few hours.
        Virtual machines have a longer lifecycle than containers, and are best used for longer periods of time.
        The way forward for your organization will depend on everything from the size of your operations and
        workflows to your IT culture and skill sets. And, containerization and virtualization technologies are coming
        together in some interesting new ways that could influence your decision making.
    </p>
    <p>After taking a look at each of these technologies, the question is,
        which one should be used? The answer is that it depends on several different points.
        Essentially, each business and application will have different needs, requirements, and purpose.
        The choice of virtualization versus containerization depends on the business development and operational model,
        and the way applications are written and produced.
    </p>
    <img src="image/container2.jpg">
    <p>When it comes to speed, containers were meant to significantly reduce the time needed to deploy and run an application.
        The container starts immediately, since the operating system is already up and running, so the application will start up
        without any noticeable delay. This is an excellent solution for a development environment, mainly,
        as it saves time in the application testing cycle. On the other hand, virtual machines need to start the
        entire operating system, which includes the full boot process. This will also include the startup of the services,
        and it will take much longer than it would for a container.
    </p>
    <p>Containers are highly suitable for short-term application needs, as they can be set up quickly, are portable,
        and can be started up much faster. They are, however, limited by the lack of a dedicated operating system,
        processing, and storage resources. Containers should be used when the biggest priority is maximizing the number of
        applications running on a minimal amount of servers. However, virtual machines are far better suited for applications
        that need to be used for an extended period of time, since they run in a virtualized environment that is more robust and
        versatile.
    </p>
    <p>Since container images are much smaller than virtual machines, they are easier to transfer and
        save space on the host’s filesystem. Virtual machines, on the other hand, need to have a copy of the whole operating
        system, including the kernel, system libraries, configuration files,
        all the directories required by the operating system and all the utilities.
        This dramatically increases the size of the image and is not that easy to share.
        Container images can be shared in any manner of ways, and there are a number of application
        sharing hubs on the internet. Virtual machine images do not have such centralized hubs and
        would usually need to be uploaded to another server instead.</p>
