    <h1>What is Containerization?</h1>
    <p>Containerization is the technique of bringing virtualization to the operating system level.
        While Virtualization brings abstraction to the hardware, Containerization brings abstraction
        to the operating system. Do note that Containerization is also a type of Virtualization.
        Containerization is however more efficient because there is no guest OS here and utilizes a
        host’s operating system, share relevant libraries & resources as and when needed unlike virtual
        machines. Application specific binaries and libraries of containers run on the host kernel, which
        makes processing and execution very fast. Even booting-up a container takes only a fraction of a
        second. Because all the containers share, host operating system and holds only the application
        related binaries & libraries. They are lightweight and faster than Virtual Machines.
    </p>
    <p>Containerization allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely.
        With traditional methods, code is developed in a specific computing environment which, when
        transferred to a new location, often results in bugs and errors. For example, when a developer
        transfers code from a desktop computer to a virtual machine (VM) or from a Linux to a Windows
        operating system. Containerization eliminates this problem by bundling the application code
        together with the related configuration files, libraries, and dependencies required for it to run.
        This single package of software or “container” is abstracted away from the host operating system,
        and hence, it stands alone and becomes portable—able to run across any platform or cloud,
        free of issues.
    </p>
    <h2>How Containers Work?</h2>
    <p>Containerization involves bundling an application together with all of its related configuration
        files, libraries and dependencies required for it to run in an efficient and bug-free way across
        different computing environments.
    </p>
    <img src="image/container-what-is-container.png"/>
    <p>In containerization, containers hold all of the figurative nuts and bolts needed to run a program.
        This runtime environment could include files, libraries and environment variables that allow a program
        to be executable.</p>
    <p>Because containers don’t require their own operating systems to execute applications, they consume
        fewer resources in a server, virtual or cloud environment. Apart from understanding the framework,
        it is also important to note the outcomes. An image is what results from the complete set of runtime
        components in a single container. And images are deployed by a container onto a chosen host.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Containerization?</h2>
    <img src="image/benefit_containerization.png"/>
    <ul>Containerization offers significant benefits to developers and development teams. Among these
        are the following:

        <li>Portability: A container creates an executable package of software that is abstracted away from
            (not tied to or dependent upon) the host operating system, and hence, is portable and able to run
            uniformly and consistently across any platform or cloud.
        </li>
        <li>Agility: The open source Docker Engine for running containers started the industry standard for
            containers with simple developer tools and a universal packaging approach that works on both Linux
            and Windows operating systems. The container ecosystem has shifted to engines managed by the Open
            Container Initiative (OCI). Software developers can continue using agile or DevOps tools and processes
            for rapid application development and enhancement.
        </li>
        <li>Speed: Containers are often referred to as “lightweight,” meaning they share the machine’s
            operating system (OS) kernel and are not bogged down with this extra overhead. Not only does this
            drive higher server efficiencies, it also reduces server and licensing costs while speeding up
            start-times as there is no operating system to boot.
        </li>
        <li>Fault isolation: Each containerized application is isolated and operates independently of others.
            The failure of one container does not affect the continued operation of any other containers.
            Development teams can identify and correct any technical issues within one container without any
            downtime in other containers. Also, the container engine can leverage any OS security isolation
            techniques—such as SELinux access control—to isolate faults within containers.
        </li>
        <li>Efficiency: Software running in containerized environments shares the machine’s OS kernel, and
            application layers within a container can be shared across containers. Thus, containers are
            inherently smaller in capacity than a VM and require less start-up time, allowing far more
            containers to run on the same compute capacity as a single VM. This drives higher server
            efficiencies, reducing server and licensing costs.
        </li>
        <li>Ease of management: A container orchestration platform automates the installation, scaling, and
            management of containerized workloads and services. Container orchestration platforms can ease
            management tasks such as scaling containerized apps, rolling out new versions of apps, and providing
            monitoring, logging and debugging, among other functions. Kubernetes, perhaps the most popular
            container orchestration system available, is an open source technology (originally open-sourced by
            Google, based on their internal project called Borg) that automates Linux container functions originally.
            Kubernetes works with many container engines, such as Docker, but it also works with any container
            system that conforms to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards for container image formats and
            runtimes.
        </li>
        <li>Security: The isolation of applications as containers inherently prevents the invasion of malicious
            code from affecting other containers or the host system. Additionally, security permissions can be
            defined to automatically block unwanted components from entering containers or limit communications
            with unnecessary resources.
        </li>
