    <h1>What is Virtualization?</h1>
    <img src="image/what_is_virtualization.png">
    <p>Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the
        actual hardware.
        Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously. To the
        applications running
        on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the
        operating system, libraries,
        and other programs are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which
        sits below it.
    </p>
    <p>Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware
        elements of a single
        computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called
        virtual machines (VMs).
        Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, even though it is running
        on just a portion of
        the actual underlying computer hardware.
    </p>
    <h2>How does virtualization work?</h2>
    <p>Software called hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments—the things that need
        those resources.
        Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a laptop) or be installed directly onto hardware
        (like a server), which is
        how most enterprises virtualize. Hypervisors take your physical resources and divide them up so that virtual
        environments can use them.
    </p>
    <img src="image/how-virtualization-works-400x217.png">
    <p>Resources are partitioned as needed from the physical environment to the many virtual environments. Users
        interact with and run computations
        within the virtual environment (typically called a guest machine or virtual machine). The virtual machine
        functions as a single data file.
        And like any digital file, it can be moved from one computer to another, opened in either one, and be expected
        to work the same.
    </p>
    <p>When the virtual environment is running and a user or program issues an instruction that requires additional
        resources from the physical
        environment, the hypervisor relays the request to the physical system and caches the changes—which all happens
        at close to native speed
        (particularly if the request is sent through an open source hypervisor based on KVM, the Kernel-based Virtual
        Machine).
    </p>
    <h2>What is Hypervisors?</h2>
    <p>A hypervisor is the software layer that coordinates VMs. It serves as an interface between the VM and the
        underlying physical hardware,
        ensuring that each has access to the physical resources it needs to execute. It also ensures that the VMs don’t
        interfere with each other
        by impinging on each other’s memory space or compute cycles.</p>
    <ul>There are two types of hypervisors:
        <li>Type 1 or “bare-metal” hypervisors interact with the underlying physical resources, replacing the
            traditional operating system altogether.
            They most commonly appear in virtual server scenarios.
        </li>
        <li>Type 2 hypervisors run as an application on an existing OS. Most commonly used on endpoint devices to run
            alternative operating systems,
            they carry a performance overhead because they must use the host OS to access and coordinate the underlying
            hardware resources.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits of virtualization?</h2>
    <ul>Virtualization brings several benefits to data center operators and service providers:
        <li>Resource efficiency: Before virtualization, each application server required its own dedicated physical
            CPU—IT staff would purchase
            and configure a separate server for each application they wanted to run. (IT preferred one application and
            one operating system (OS) per
            computer for reliability reasons.) Invariably, each physical server would be underused. In contrast, server
            virtualization lets you run
            several applications—each on its own VM with its own OS—on a single physical computer (typically an x86
            server) without sacrificing reliability.
            This enables maximum utilization of the physical hardware’s computing capacity.
        </li>
        <li>Easier management: Replacing physical computers with software-defined VMs makes it easier to use and manage
            policies written in software.
            This allows you to create automated IT service management workflows. For example, automated deployment and
            configuration tools enable administrators
            to define collections of virtual machines and applications as services, in software templates. This means
            that they can install those services
            repeatedly and consistently without cumbersome, time-consuming. and error-prone manual setup. Admins can use
            virtualization security policies to
            mandate certain security configurations based on the role of the virtual machine. Policies can even increase
            resource efficiency by retiring unused
            virtual machines to save on space and computing power.
        </li>
        <li>Minimal downtime: OS and application crashes can cause downtime and disrupt user productivity. Admins can
            run multiple redundant virtual machines
            alongside each other and failover between them when problems arise. Running multiple redundant physical
            servers is more expensive.
        </li>
        <li>Faster provisioning: Buying, installing, and configuring hardware for each application is time-consuming.
            Provided that the hardware is already
            in place, provisioning virtual machines to run all your applications is significantly faster. You can even
            automate it using management software and
            build it into existing workflows.
